			<h2 class="sub-heading">What i look for in a Mint</h2>
			<p class="post-text"><br>Always looking for mints that have a lot of hype on there twitter and discord.</p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>Art and Utility provided must be very good for me to go for the mint.</p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>Always check the website and twitter (check interactions make sure its not botted) and check if their project is being spoken about.</p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>I like to base a mints hype off of the emotes they are recieving on discord and when you are going to mint a project NEVER MINT STRAIGHT AWAY.. be patient if you have whitelist check how the volume is and if its looking like it will sell out then go for the mint. </p>
			<p class="post-text">If you are new to the space make sure you have 0.05 SOL extra in your wallet for fees and i ALWAYS recommend using a burner wallet. (an extra wallet with nothing inside other then the mint money.. </p>
			<p class="post-text">(this prevents u from getting ur wallet drained in case of a scam). </p>
			<p class="post-text">   <i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>  DEMAND / HYPE IS EVERYTHING </p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>Getting into Secondary Plays this is more of a tricky one. </p>
			<p class="post-text"> First of all calls can go either way but i like to increase my win ratio by following a few rules. crossed_swords </p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>If you have been in my discord then you know i tend to play much safer but 95% of the time it works out like literally.</p>
			<p class="post-text">I tend to get into plays that i know are either undervalued you will know this by researching a project and checking on what they offer and what they plan to offer ex. </p>
			<p class="post-text">Sol Decoder these guys where at 1 SOL at a time and through researching the utility and seeing how dedicated the owner is i knew he was going to keep building which overtime will lead to more people getting to know about he's project and buying in.</p>
			<p class="post-text">(so owner activity and future / current project utilities)</p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>Another thing i love to consider when taking a trade is buying the rumour and selling the news.</p>
			<p class="post-text">Realistically if a rumour comes out in this space 90% of the time it does come true thats what ive learnt</p>
			<p class="post-text"> These rumours can be such as Collabs with Big projects ex (Degods and Pompeizz collabed and pompeizz did a 2.5x) or utility rumours.</p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>Current Market situations is also what ive been taking more into account. What i mean by this is where SOL / BTC is leaning towards before i take a play.</p>
			<p class="post-text">If it looks uber bearish i dont take the trade cause it lowers profit chances.</p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>One last thing that i love to consider is charts.</p>
			<p class="post-text">Yes you heard me right charting is actually a big factor in my plays.. </p>
			<p class="post-text">You can chart NFTs like you do with crypto and although it isnt 100% accurate it gives a good indication to where a project is leaning towards to.</p>
			<p class="post-text">I chart using the website solsniper</p>
			<p class="post-text"><br>All these factors take a toll on my play and yes you cant always be right but you should always try to play with the success ratio leaning on your side. handshake</p>
